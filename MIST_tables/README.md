## MIST tables

This directory contains the MIST tables used in the Garraffo et al. 2018 model. The MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks (Paxton et al. (2011); Dotter (2016);
Choi et al. (2016); Paxton & Bildsten (2010); Paxton et al. (2013, 2017); Gossage et al. (2021)) contain stellar evolution data of basic stellar parameters
such as radius, moment of intertia, convective turnover time and mass.

In this directory there are also two python scripts. MIST_tables_plots.py displays the evolution of basic stellar parameters for each stellar mass in the MIST tables.
read_mist_models.py contains a class that allows us to read the MIST tables by importing it in our scripts.
