#Simulating the Stellar Galactic X-ray Emission of Cool Stars for Exoplanet
Habitability

*Note*: This is my Master's project. I have been working on it from the beginning of August. It's still an ongoing process but here I present some of the scripts I have been creating over the past months.

##Abstract

Stellar coronal X-ray and EUV emissions heat and evaporate planetary atmospheres. Understanding their evolution through
time can give us new insight into exoplanet habitability. In this work, we make a first attempt at simulating the X-ray emission of
a realistic synthetic stellar galactic population by employing the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) model, together with
the Garraffo et al. (2018) spin-down model and the Wright et al. (2011) model of stellar X-ray emission (𝐿 𝑥 ). Using observed
𝐿 𝑥 data, we will test the stellar rotation and X-ray emission models, both statistically (comparing GUMS to X-ray survey data)
and through matching Gaia data of stars with determined masses and ages with Chandra observations (using machine learning
techniques). This takes us a step forward in building a trustworthy model that describes these stars’ rotation rate and the resulting
X-ray emission.
